# Ralph Agent Instructions (TypeScript Library)

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a **TypeScript library** using **opencode**.

## CRITICAL: Branch Rules

**DO NOT TOUCH THE `main` BRANCH. IT IS PRODUCTION.**

- **Base branch**: `feat/dashboard-component` (treat this as your "main")
- **Create feature branches from**: `feat/dashboard-component`
- **Merge/rebase back to**: `feat/dashboard-component`
- **NEVER**: checkout `main`, merge to `main`, rebase onto `main`, or push to `main`

When starting work:
```bash
git checkout feat/dashboard-component
git pull origin feat/dashboard-component
git checkout -b feat/<issue-id>-<short-description>
```

## Project Context

This is a **TypeScript library**. Key things to know:

- **Package manager**: bun (NOT npm/yarn)
- **Test file**: `quickstart.ts` - This is the example file that demonstrates library usage and where we test everything
- **Dev server**: `bun dev` starts the local development server for testing

## Your Task

1. Run `bd ready` to find available work (issues with no blockers)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Ensure you're on `feat/dashboard-component` or a feature branch off of it. **NEVER checkout main.**
4. Pick the first available issue from `bd ready` output
5. Create a feature branch from `feat/dashboard-component`: `git checkout -b feat/<issue-id>-<description>`
6. Run `bd update <id> --status in_progress` to claim the work
7. Run `bd show <id>` to view full issue details
8. Implement that single issue
9. Run quality checks: `bun test`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`
10. Test your changes using `quickstart.ts`
11. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
12. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Issue ID] - [Issue Title]`
13. Run `bd close <id>` to mark the issue complete
14. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Development Workflow

### Running the Dev Server
```bash
bun dev    # Starts local development server
```

### Testing Changes
The `quickstart.ts` file is the primary way to test the library:
```bash
bun run quickstart.ts    # Run the example/test file
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
bun test           # Run tests
bun run lint       # Run linter
bun run typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
bun run build      # Build the library
```

## bd CLI Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                          # Find available work (no blockers, open/in_progress)
bd show <id>                      # View full issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd update <id> --status open      # Release work back to pool
bd close <id>                     # Complete and close issue
bd close <id> -r "reason"         # Close with reason
bd sync                           # Sync with git remote
bd list                           # List all issues
bd list --status open             # List open issues only
bd create --title "..." --description "..."  # Create new issue
```

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Issue ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the main export is in src/index.ts")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: All public APIs are exported from src/index.ts
- Example: Use `bun dev` to test changes locally
- Example: quickstart.ts is the integration test file
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**
- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Always test changes via quickstart.ts before committing"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns
- Always verify changes work via `quickstart.ts`

## Browser Testing (Required for UI/Visual Features)

For any issue that requires browser testing, you MUST verify it works using dev-browser:

1. Start the dev server: `bun dev`
2. Delegate browser testing to a subagent:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "general"

"Use Playwright MCP to test the library changes:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:[PORT]
2. Verify [specific behavior from quickstart.ts]
3. Take a screenshot if needed
4. Report back: what worked, what failed, any issues found"
```

The subagent will handle all Playwright interactions. A browser-dependent feature is NOT complete until browser verification passes.

## Stop Condition

After completing an issue, run `bd ready` again to check for remaining work.

If `bd ready` shows no more issues (all work complete), reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still issues available, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next issue).

## Important

- **NEVER touch the `main` branch** - it is production
- **Always branch from `feat/dashboard-component`**
- **This is a TypeScript library** - maintain type safety
- **Use `quickstart.ts`** to test all changes
- **Use `bun dev`** to run the local dev server
- Work on ONE issue per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
- Use `bd sync` before pushing to ensure issue state is synced with git

## opencode CLI Reference

For reference, opencode supports these key options:
```bash
opencode                    # Start TUI
opencode run [message..]    # Run with a message (non-interactive)
opencode -c, --continue     # Continue the last session
opencode -s, --session <id> # Continue a specific session
opencode -m, --model <model># Use specific model (provider/model format)
opencode mcp                # Manage MCP servers
opencode export [sessionID] # Export session data
```
